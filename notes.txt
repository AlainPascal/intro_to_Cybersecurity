	The World of CyberSecurity

		What is Cybersecurity
			It is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

			On a personal level, one needs to safeguard their identity, data, and computing devices.
			At an organizational level, it is everyone's responsibility to protect the organization's reputation, data and customers.
			As more as digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital at the government level, where national security, economic stability and the safety and wellbeing of citizens are at stake.

		Protecting Personal Data
			Personal data is any information that can be used to identify someone, and it can exist both offline and onine.

			Offline identity
				is the real-life persona that is presented on a daily basis at home, at school or at work.
				As a result, family and friends know details about one's personal life, including full name, age and address.

				It is important to overlook the importance of securing offline identity because identity thieves can easily steal data.

			Online identity
				is not just a name, it is who one is and how they present themselves to others online.
				It includes the username or alias used for online accounts, as well as the social identity established and portrayed on online communities and websites.
				Take care to limit the amount of personal information revealed through online identity.

				Many people think that if they do not have any social media or online accounts set up, then they do not have an online identity. This is not the case, if one uses the web, they have an online identity.

		Data
			Personal data describes any information including name, social security number, driver license number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, and even pictures or messages that are exchanged with family and friends.

			Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate someone, infringing on their privacy and potentially causing serious damage to their reputation.

			Medical records (
				Personal information regarding physical and mental health and wellbeing is added to electronic health records, EHRs, when visiting the doctor.
				Since the majority of these records are saved online, there is need to be aware of the information that is shared.
				And these records go beyond the bound of the doctor's office. For example, many fitness trackers collect large amounts of clinical data such as heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar levels, which is transferred, stored and displayed via the cloud. Therefore, consider this data to be part of medical records
			)
			Education records (
				Educational records contain information about academic qualifications and achievements. However, these records may also include contact information, attendance records, disciplinary reports, health and immunization records as well as any special education records including individualized education programs, IEPs
			)
			Employment and financial records (
				Employment data can be valuable to hackers if they can gather information on past employment, or even current performance reviews.
				Financial record may include information about income and expenditure. Tax records may include paychecks, credit cards statements, credit rating and bank account details. All of this data, if not safeguarded properly, can compromise privacy and enable cybercriminals to use it for their own gain.

		Where Is Your Data ?
			This has got you thinking. Only yesterday, you shared a couple of photos of your first day on the job with a few of your close friends.
			You took some photos at work on your mobile phone. Copies of these photos are now available on your mobile device.
			You shared these with five close friends, who live in various locations across the world.
			All of your friends downloaded the photos and now have copies of your photos on their devices.
			One of your friends was so proud that they decided to post and share your photos online. The photos are no longer just on device. They have in fact ended up on servers located in different part of the world and people whom you do not even know now have access to your photos.

			This is just one example that reminds us that every time we collect or share personal data, we should consider our security. There are different laws that protect your privacy and data in your country. But do you know where your data is ?

			Following an appointment, the doctor will update your medical record. For billing purposes, this information may be shared with the insurance company. In such cases, your medical record, or part of it, is now accessible at at the insurance company.

			Store loyalty cards may be convenient to save money on your purchases. However, the store is using this card to build a profile of your purchasing behavior, which it can then use to target you with special offers from its marketing partners.
