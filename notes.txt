	The World of CyberSecurity

		What is Cybersecurity
			It is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

			On a personal level, one needs to safeguard their identity, data, and computing devices.
			At an organizational level, it is everyone's responsibility to protect the organization's reputation, data and customers.
			As more as digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital at the government level, where national security, economic stability and the safety and wellbeing of citizens are at stake.

		Protecting Personal Data
			Personal data is any information that can be used to identify someone, and it can exist both offline and onine.

			Offline identity
				is the real-life persona that is presented on a daily basis at home, at school or at work.
				As a result, family and friends know details about one's personal life, including full name, age and address.

				It is important to overlook the importance of securing offline identity because identity thieves can easily steal data.

			Online identity
				is not just a name, it is who one is and how they present themselves to others online.
				It includes the username or alias used for online accounts, as well as the social identity established and portrayed on online communities and websites.
				Take care to limit the amount of personal information revealed through online identity.

				Many people think that if they do not have any social media or online accounts set up, then they do not have an online identity. This is not the case, if one uses the web, they have an online identity.

		Data
			Personal data describes any information including name, social security number, driver license number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, and even pictures or messages that are exchanged with family and friends.

			Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate someone, infringing on their privacy and potentially causing serious damage to their reputation.
